# CSCapstone-CCApprover
My WGU Capstone Project, which includes a machine learning model that can approve or deny new credit card applications.

The project portion (not the documentation) was created in Jupyter Notebook.

The document includes a link to a Binder, which requires no local setup to run and interact with the Notebook, although, the 
.ipynb files are included in this repository.
